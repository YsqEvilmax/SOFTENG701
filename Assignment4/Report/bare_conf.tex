\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.

% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.
\usepackage{float}
\usepackage[top=1in, bottom=1in, left=0.75in, right=0.75in]{geometry}
\usepackage{scrextend}
\addtokomafont{labelinglabel}{\sffamily}

\input{parts/image.tex}
\input{parts/table.tex}





% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
% \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
% \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
% or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
% will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
% driver is specified.
% \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
% \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

	\section{Introduction}
	% no \IEEEPARstart
	The modifiability of code, which means the capability of the software product to be modified, is one of the important attributes when software designers evaluate the quality of their designs. As a sub-characteristic of maintainability, it can localise changes, prevent ripple effects and defer binding time. To practice and show my understanding of modifiability, in this report, I use a simple but popular game named Kalah,  which has multiple different ways to play, as an example. My design will be explained in detial with UML diagrams in the next section.

	\section{Modifiablity Defination}
	

	\input{parts/overall.tex}	
	\input{parts/metrics_a.tex}
	
	\section{Design Explanation}
	To reach a better modifiability, usually some design patterns and OOP approaches (abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance) should be properly applied. My detailed design of Kalah game is showed as below. There are totally 6 packages in my implementation, each of them contains a group of classes which are tightly interrelated.
	
	\subsection{kalah}
	
	\ImageBlock{kalah}{The design of kalah package.}
	
	As showed in Figure~\ref{fig:kalah}, there are only 2 class in this package: Kalah and Game. By inheriting from Game, which is the abstraction of games in the real world, the Kalah only needs to (also has to) implement the logics in Idle(), AddPlayers() and AddActions(). 
	
	\Item{Modifiablity}{With the inheritance from Game, developers can define not only Kalah but also other games by simply creating a class and implementing the abstract functions defined in Game (Idle, AddPlayers, AddActions).}
	
	\subsection{kalah.playeraction}
	
	\ImageBlock{kalah_playeraction}{The design of kalah.playeraction package.}
	
	This package defines the most important 2 parts in a Game: the players and their actions. 
	
	As Figure~\ref{fig:kalah_playeraction} indicates, each action (for example SowAction) implementing IAction interface has its own Do functionality, in which the logics of this action should be; each player (for example KalahPlayer) implementing IPerson has its own Act functionality, which receives a instance of IAction and then handles it.
	
	\Item{Modifiablity}{With this design, developer can define different users executing different actions by inheriting GameUser and GameAction and implementing the detialed logics in their Do() and Act() respectively.}
	
	\subsection{kalah.structure}
	
	\ImageBlock{kalah_structure}{The design of kalah.structure package.}
	
	This package defines the data structure of Kalah game. As we see from Figure~\ref{fig:kalah_structure}, basically, there are 2 kinds of Container, House and Store. They all have a Group which they belong to, meanwhile, each House instance holds its own index.  
	
	A Group is a ContainerSelector which can select elements in its collection according to their type and itorate them linearly.
	
	A PlayBoard is a CircularSelector of Group which can iterate elements in its collection circularly.
	
	\Item{Modifiablity}{With this design, the virtual layout of play board can be easily changed by using different components (Store, House and Group). For example, we can have a new play board which support 5 or more players, and each of them has Store and House one by one in a Group.}
	
	\subsection{kalah.rule}
	
	\ImageBlock{kalah_rule}{The design of kalah.rule package.}
	
	After players' action, the rules of the game will have effects. They are all defined as Figure~\ref{fig:kalah_rule} shows. Here I use a design pattern called "observer".
	
	If the RuleObserver observe a rule (for example CaptureOpponent) after player's action, the rule will affect the game automatically.
	
	\Item{Modifiablity}{With this design, the Game could have more rules by creating new rule classes which implement the IRule interface. They will bring more joy and complexity to this game.}
	
	\subsection{kalah.selector}
	
	\ImageBlock{kalah_selector}{The design of kalah.selector package.}
	
	The purpose of this package is to provide multiple ways to loop through and get certain element in a collection, details are showed in Figure~\ref{fig:kalah_selector}.
	
	The ISelectable interface defines the basic API of a selector.
	
	The Selector class is abstract, which has a collection of elements and is able to return the element which is pointed by current index.
	
	The LinearSelector and CircularSelector implement 2 ways to iterate each elements in its collection respectively.
	
	The ContainerSelector has to be a LinearSelector which holds a collection of Cotainer instances. This class can dynamically add and remove Store instance. It is also able to return subsets of its collection according to the type of elements.  
	
	\Item{Modifiablity}{With this design, the new iteration way (for example skip a house in each step of sowing) can be achieved easily by adding a new selector to the game, if required.}
	
	\subsection{kalah.dump}
	
	\ImageBlock{kalah_dump}{The design of kalah.dump package.}
	As Figure~\ref{fig:kalah_dump} demonstrates, the IDumpable interface replaces the dump processing functionality by accept(). Each class who would like to access MockIO and dispaly anything should inherit it. 
	
	The DumpVisitor lets you define a new displaying operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
	
	The DumpSingleton class holds a static instance of DumpVisitor, providing global access to DumpVisitor.Visit().
	
	\Item{Modifiablity}{With this design, the classes who want to print anything to MockIO merely need to implement the methods defined in IDumpable interface. The DumpVisitor lets you define a new dump operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. The DumpVisitor's global accessibility is guaranteed by DumpSingleton.}
	
	
	\section{Design Result}
	
	\ImageBlock{design_result}{The execution result of my design.}
	
	My implementation has been tested under JRE 1.8 and JUnit 4.12. As we can see from Figure~\ref{fig:design_result}, it is able to pass all of the 19 test cases.
	
	
	% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
	% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
	% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
	% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
	% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
	% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
	% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
	% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
	%
	% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
	% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
	% displayed while in draft mode.
	%
	%\begin{figure}[!t]
	%\centering
	%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
	% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
	% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
	% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
	%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
	%\label{fig_sim}
	%\end{figure}
	
	% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
	% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.
	
	
	% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
	% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
	% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
	% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
	% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
	% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
	% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
	%
	%\begin{figure*}[!t]
	%\centering
	%\subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
	%\label{fig_first_case}}
	%\hfil
	%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
	%\label{fig_second_case}}
	%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
	%\label{fig_sim}
	%\end{figure*}
	%
	% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
	% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
	% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
	% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
	% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
	% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
	% e.g., \subfloat[].
	
	
	% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
	% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
	% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
	% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
	% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
	% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
	% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
	% The \label must come after \caption as always.
	%
	%\begin{table}[!t]
	%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
	%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
	% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
	% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
	%\caption{An Example of a Table}
	%\label{table_example}
	%\centering
	%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
	%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
	%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
	%\hline
	%One & Two\\
	%\hline
	%Three & Four\\
	%\hline
	%\end{tabular}
	%\end{table}
	
	
	% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
	% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
	% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
	% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
	% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
	% top floats exclusively. 
	% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
	% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
	% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.

	I would like to express my special thanks of gratitude to my lecturer Ewan, whose critical thinking skills and humour in lecturing really impress me and teach me a lot. If there exists any marker on this assignment, I think he/she definitely also deserves my thanks, because reading and testing such a massive code must be torturing and time-consuming.
